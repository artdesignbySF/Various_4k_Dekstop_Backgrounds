Backstory:
I spent some time to create various sets of 4k background images for my new OLED screen. I used Midjourney. Then upscalled to 4K in photoshop and dropped the weight per image from ~10 Mb to ~1 Mb or less. 
My initial reason for creating these is to have them rotate in the background to reduce chances of burn in.
Can also be used as regular background images to your screen, no matter the resolution, as long as it is in a 16:9 aspect ratio.
